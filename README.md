these are my codes for the assignments given in the bbm103 class in Hacettepe Uni.

bbm103 is the programming lab class for the first term in Hacettepe Computer Science, and it's main goal is to make an introduction to programming with python.

introductions about the assignments are in the pdfs carrying the same name as the folders.

example input - output files can be found in the "io" folders.
